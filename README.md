## Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across the U.S., highlighting a major growth surge since 2021, with 2023 exceeding registrations from 2016–2020 combined. Higher-income groups (above $50,000) show greater EV adoption, while affordability remains a barrier for lower-income segments. California leads in charging infrastructure due to its wealthy population and policies. Factors like electricity cost, political engagement, education level, and employment rates also influence adoption patterns. Emerging states like New Mexico show strong investment potential, while Oklahoma recorded the highest YOY EV growth in 2018.

## Uncovering the Drivers of EV Adoption in USA
### 1. EV Market Growth (2021–2023)
Since 2021, the electric vehicle (EV) market has experienced a significant boom in registrations. The year 2023, in particular, recorded a sharp increase—exceeding the combined registrations from 2016 to 2020.

### 2. EV Affordability by Income Level
Individuals with annual incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 generally do not prefer or cannot afford EVs. However, those earning above $50,000 are more likely to purchase EVs, as they are financially more accessible for that income group.

### 3. California Leads in Charging Infrastructure
California ranks highest in the number of EV charging outlets. This is largely attributed to its affluent population, including multimillionaires, actors, and public figures. Given the high cost of EVs, regions with higher income levels tend to adopt EVs more readily and develop supporting infrastructure.

### 4. Electricity Costs and EV Adoption
Lower electricity prices are associated with higher EV adoption. To maximize profit and market reach, EV manufacturers should focus on developing vehicles and components that consume less power during charging.

### 5. Political Engagement and EV Adoption
The visualization suggests a correlation between politically active regions and higher EV adoption. This may reflect stronger policy support, advocacy, or funding for green technology initiatives.

###  6. Emerging EV-Adopting States
New states are rapidly adopting EV technology. It would not be surprising if some current top 10 states in EV adoption are overtaken by newer, more aggressive adopters—possibly even surpassing leading states like California.

### 7. Education Level and EV Adoption
The data indicates that higher education levels may influence EV adoption. This could be due to greater environmental awareness, higher income, or better access to new technologies. However, factors such as infrastructure, policy, and affordability also play important roles.

### 8. New Mexico’s Investment Potential
New Mexico appears at the top in this particular subset, possibly indicating strong economic capacity or potential for significant investment in EV infrastructure.

### 9. Unemployment and EV Registration
The chart suggests that lower unemployment rates are associated with higher EV registrations. This is evident from the thicker concentration of data points in areas with lower unemployment.

###  10. Oklahoma’s EV Growth in 2018
Oklahoma recorded the highest year-over-year growth in EV registrations, with a remarkable increase of 208.33% in 2018.

## Suggestions
1. Expand Charging Infrastructure Nationwide — Increase accessible and fast charging stations beyond leading states like California to support wider adoption.

2. Make EVs More Affordable — Develop affordable models or provide subsidies to help lower- and middle-income groups buy EVs.

3. Lower Electricity Costs or Improve Charging Efficiency — Promote cheaper electricity and energy-efficient charging technologies to reduce ownership costs.

4. Enhance Public Awareness and Education — Boost outreach programs to educate people on EV benefits, targeting less-informed communities.

5. Support Stronger Policies and Incentives — Encourage government policies and incentives that promote EV adoption and infrastructure development.


## summary

The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market has grown quickly since 2021. In 2023, more people registered EVs than in all the years from 2016 to 2020 combined. People who earn more than $50,000 are more likely to buy EVs. California has the most charging stations. Lower electricity prices, better education, and active politics help more people use EVs. Some states like New Mexico are growing fast, and Oklahoma had a big jump in EV registrations in 2018.
